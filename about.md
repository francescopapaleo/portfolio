My journey has started as a sound engineer, for over 15 years I have been working in the music industry, on worldwide tours as well as in studio or interactive installations. My approach has always been to merge art and creativity with technology, employing cutting-edge DSP software and hardware to deliver unparalleled auditory experiences in the diverse settings I have worked in.

Holding a Bachelor's degree in Cultures and Human Rights and another in Electronic Music Composition, I see music as an interdisciplinary realm that connects art, science, and society. Recently I completed the Master's degree in Sound and Music Computing at the Music Technology Group in Barcelona, where I explored the human-AI interface and the potential of machine learning for sound and music generation and analysis. My mission is to bridge art and technology, crafting sound and music that resonate deeply with human emotions and values.
